#dotfiles

My Terminal and (future) Vim setup.

#Installation

Clone this repo into your home directory and run the install.sh script

```bash
sh install.sh
```


The script will make a backup of your existing dotfiles (that match the ones that it's setting up) in the

```
~/dotfiles/oldFiles
```

directory, it then symlinks the new files.
